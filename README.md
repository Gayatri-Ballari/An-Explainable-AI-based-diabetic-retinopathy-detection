# An-Explainable-AI-based-diabetic-retinopathy-detection
Automated detection of Diabetic retinopathy using deep learning technique and provide Explain-ability technique to help us better understands our model's predictions, and how we could further improve its performance.




Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor. Early symptoms include floaters, blurriness, dark areas of vision and difficulty perceiving colors. Blindness can occur. Mild cases may be treated with careful diabetes management. Advanced cases may require laser treatment or surgery. Detection is essential to prevent loss of vision. In this project, automated detection of diabetic retinopathy using optic disk and optic cup using deep learning/machine learning techniques explanation. 

In this work, a baseline VGG16 will be trained, evaluate the model, and use LIME model explain ability technique to help ophthalmologist better understand model's predictions, and how we could further improve its performance. The result obtained with deep learning based VGG16 model and the accuracy is 91.30%.
